Habitat images give viewers more information about your subject’s life and the environment in which it lives. They also give the subject and its surroundings a feeling of scale.Due to the absence of extreme focal length (400–600mm), you may discover that your chosen style of photography leans toward including more of the environment, or you may be confined to capture the full scene.",
